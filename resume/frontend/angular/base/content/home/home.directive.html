    <p> This website was created by me, Avi Frankl, primarily using AngularJS 1.5.8, and Django.  Other technologies that I used to create this webpage include gulp, bower, sass, and bootstrap.  On the angular side, I imported libraries such as ui-router and angular-bootstrap.</p>

    <p> I created this website in order to provide an open source example of a website that is primarily run on the client-side.  I believe this form of web design will be prominent in the future, because it puts very little pressure on the server.  Why lift a ton of bricks by yourself when you can get 20 people to do it for you? </p>
    
    <p> I also created this website to help strengthen my chance at finding a web or mobile engineering job for myself.  The content of the website is primarily for recruiters to see.  It intends to do a much better job of displaying my skills, bio, past work experience, projects, and (more generally) who I am as an engineer than a single-page resume. Having said that:</p>

    <p class="p-all-xs"> <strong> You can find my resume by going to the "Resume" tab, and cover letter by going to the "Cover Letter" tab on the side menu.  You can also download my resume as a .png file by navigating to the "Downloads" menu item in the top navigation bar</strong></p>

<p class="m-all-sm"><strong>In the side menu bar, you can see a list of tabs.  These tabs will help you navigate through my professional history, education, and freelance work.  If you don't have time to check out every tab, I have them summarized here.</strong></p>

        <p class="m-b-none">I grew up in Southern California.  I went to a small private school called Viewpoint for high school, and then went to Berkeley for my undergradiate degree where I got my B.A. in Computer Science.  While in college, I was a prominent member of the California Alpha chapter of Phi Delta Theta.  I also took a huge interest in mobile development, specifically with iOS, and started (but have yet to finish) an application that will be called Next Hop.</p>
