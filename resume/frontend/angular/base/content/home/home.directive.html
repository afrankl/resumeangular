        <p> I created this website to help strengthen my chance at finding a web or mobile engineering job for myself.  The content of the website is primarily for recruiters to see.  It intends to do a much better job of displaying my skills, bio, past work experience, projects, and more generally who I am as an engineer than a single-page resume.</p>

I went to a small private school called Viewpoint for high school, and then went to Berkeley for my undergradiate degree where I got my B.A. in Computer Science.  While in college, I was a prominent member of the California Alpha chapter of Phi Delta Theta.  I also took a huge interest in mobile development, specifically with iOS, and started (but have yet to finish) an application that will be called Next Hop.</p>
