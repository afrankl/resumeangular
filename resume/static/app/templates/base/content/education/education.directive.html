                <blockquote class="p-lr-sm">
                    Although commonly known as Berkeley's introductory Computer Science course, CS 61A goes above and beyond to teach the importance of knowing a programming language's environment, functional programming, and programming algorithms, and object-oriented programming.  It also covers streams, generators, sqlite, compilers, and cluster programming.  The course is taught in <strong>Python</strong>.

                    With regards to Data Structures, the course extensively covered hash maps (dictionaries), linked lists, sorting algorithms, stacks/queues, and trees (with algorithms including but not limited to binary-search and balanced-search algorithms).  It also extensively covered object-oriented programming with topics such as inheritance, variable/method types, access modifiers, and abstraction.  The course is taught in <strong>Java</strong>.

                    61C delves deep into memory management, I/O, parallelism, and virtual memory.  It primarily focuses on low-level programming, teaching the use of pointers, openMP, MIPS, and caches.  It also heavily covers clusters, teaching hadoop and MapReduce. The course is taught in <strong>C</strong> and <strong>Assembly</strong>.

                    Focusing on mobile and watch software development, this course teaches modality, storyboarding, the Design Cycle, affordance, and usability testing (amongst many other user-interface related topics).  Primarily, the course project requires students to build an Android application that utilizes a smart watch.  I used this course as motivation to build BACTracker. The course is taught in <strong>Java</strong>, or specifically, <strong>Android</strong>.

                    Focusing on both the programming and practical methods of Software Engineering, this course covers networking, web engineering frameworks, SaaS, and the Agile Lifecycle.  In this course, I was able to learn Javascript, Ruby, and the Ruby on Rails web framework.  I also got to work with College Track, a company created by Steve Jobbs wife Laura.  See more in <a ui-sref="projects">projects</a>. The course is taught in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>Ruby</strong>.

                    This course covers the essence of networking, including, E2E with TCP/IP, routing/routers, DNS, conjestion control, and internet security.  In this class we were assigned four projects involving routing, TCP/IP, and Firewalls (which consisted of two parts).  See <a ui-sref="projects">projects</a> for more details. The course was taught in <strong>Python</strong>.

                    With a strong emphasis on machine architecture and low level programming, this course was almost an extension of 61C (yet more focused on operating systems).  This course covered a lot of material.  It covered HTTP and the Internet, filesystems, the kernal, memory management, the CPU, threads, processes, semaphores, locks, deadlocks, and more.  The course was taught in <strong>C</strong>.
