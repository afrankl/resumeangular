    <p class="m-lr-md p-t-sm"> I grew up in Los Angeles.  For highschool, I went to a small private school called Viewpoint, and then went to Berkeley for my undergradiate degree where I got my B.A. in Computer Science.</p>

        <p>While in college, I was a prominent member of the California Alpha chapter of Phi Delta Theta.  My fraternity is where I lived for the majority of college.  Living with thirty other people and being apart of an organization that I wanted to thrive taught me how to work with others to achieve a common goal.</p>
        <p> With respect to my early career path, I took a big interest in mobile development, specifically in iOS.  My first computer science related job was in iOS development at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs.  I started as a summer intern, but was later rehired to work twenty-hour weeks while in school.  While working at the labs, I was the only iOS developer in my department.  I was forced to overcome any programming obstacle I had on my own, which built confidence in my own abilities.  I used this confidence as motivation to create.</p>
        <p>I learned a lot by developing my own applications.  The ones that stand out are
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>BACTracker</strong> - An Android application that promotes safe drinking by calculating a user's BAC based off number of drinks consumed, type of drinks, and user weight, height, and gender.</li>
            <li> <strong>Social</strong> - An iOS application that manages events for the user.  It intends to use geolocation to track where the user is, and whether or not he or she is at an event.  It will be user/login based.</li>
            <li> <strong>Parking Map </strong> - A Ruby on Rails application that helps a user find parking in Berkeley.  The application uses the city of Berkeley's website in order to display parking rates and times in a color coded fasion for the user.  It uses Google Maps Api.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Towards the end of my college career, I worked at an online marketing firm called Track Revenue as an intern and later as an Associate Software Engineer.  Working for a small startup I had a lot of flexibility to pass out my own ideas, and was key in making their new platform (aliased YD).  I also learned AngularJS, which is what this website is primarily created with.  Working there showed me how do-able it is to bring an idea to life, even when resources are limited. </p>
        <p> I am currently looking for a new position as a Software Engineer.  I believe the skills I've learned will allow me to be a great fit at many companies, and am eager for the future.</p>
