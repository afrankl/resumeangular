        <p> I created this website to help strengthen my chance at finding a web or mobile engineering job for myself.  The content of the website is primarily for recruiters to see.  It intends to do a much better job of displaying my skills, bio, past work experience, projects, and more generally who I am as an engineer than a single-page resume.</p>
